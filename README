This is an SQLite database of all the calls logged on Twitter by Greater Manchester Police between 5am on 14th October 2010 and 5am on 15th October 2010.

There are three columns: id, call_no, and description. The ID number is completely irrelevant to the data and just is used as a primary key. This is because the call_no has duplication in some numbers as it appears to be reset from zero before 5am, which is why the first logged call is no. 215.

Hopefully someone could get some useful metrics from this. Try searching '999' or 'garage' to get some interesting stats. I had an idea about building a Rails app to crowdsource categorizing these calls, with a view to show the benefits of transparent data like this.

If you've got any questions, let me know on Twitter @1jh :)
